Problem: Major natural disasters can and do have severe negative short-run economic impacts. Disasters also appear to have adverse longer-term consequences for economic growth. One of them include distruction important documents of affects families. These include property papers, passports, government approved identity proofs, academical cirtificates like 10th or 12th marks cards, etc. These certificates are very important for them to lead them back to normal life again. To get the certificates back they will have to wonder hundered of government offices, institutions again and again. Hundreds of people, students have commited suicide for this reason after the flood even though they were saved in the flood.

Solution: We would like to develop an app which provides simple way to get back their documents. The app should be connected to government institutes and apply for different certificates on be ahalf of them.

Implementation:
1. We collect all possible proofs to make sure that he is the right owner of the certificates which are being applied which include fingerprints, photo, phone no verification.
2. Take list of lost certificates.
3. Take concerned details of respected certifciates.
4. Take photocopies of the certificates he has retained.
5. Connet and apply them to government offices.
6. Track and show the different certificate statuses if possible.
7. Providing information/communication between user and government offices through notification of messaging.
8. Access should be provided only to flood affected people.
9. Ensure no data leakage / mishandling of user during the process.
